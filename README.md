When we have large ternary condition it becomes tidious to write or read / understand sometimes.

So the small library helps us to write structured turnery condition whick look like if / else statement and follows functinal programming rule (Rule: Do not use if / else).

This increase readability of code and it is more structured then raw ternary operation.
